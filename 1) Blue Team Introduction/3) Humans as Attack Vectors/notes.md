Weakest cyber security element = humans
Humans are targeted because of the access they can provide - to websites, mailboxes, or databases.

##Social engineering:
tactic of manipulating the victim (human) into helping the attacker, whether knowingly or not.

##Attacks on Humans:
Phishing Attacks: Email phishing.

Malware Downloads: To make these attacks more successful, threat actors use innovative techniques like fake CAPTCHAs, malicious QR codes, and SEO poisoning.

Deepfakes: Impersonation (pretending to be someone else)

##Mitigation:
Anti-phishing solution: a tool that blocks phishing emails before the users even notice

Antivirus / EDR solution: A reliable antivirus on all corporate hosts is a great measure to prevent humans from running malware

"Trust but verify" principle: Instructing employees how to detect deepfakes and verify suspicious requests from "CEO" or "IT"

Security awareness training: Teaching employees how to detect phishing and reinforce training through phishing simulations
